R&D Observations:
[] Is there any relationship between permutation rank and number of cycles?
    Trying to figure out pattern. One interesting thing I observed is that
    for factoradic/permutadic representation, it is exactly equal to number of zeroes
    if remaining digits are 1.
    For example if factoradic is 1,0,0,0,1,1,0 you can safely say that number of
    cycle/orbits is 4

[] Observation about  permutation product : a x b = (a' x b)' where a' = (max rank - rank of a)
    for example for permutation or size 4  :  3 x 11 = (3' x 11)' = (20 x 11)' = 8' = 23-8 = 15

TODO: Priority todo list
[] add test cases for start parameter
[] add check for start vs increment parameter
[] replace 'hack' implementation of mth repetitive permutation with actual

TODO:
[] Add set theory API's so that this lib will be useful for
    puzzles creators (color, arrow, killer, renban)
[] Factoradic.fromNthPermutation() similar to Permutadic.fromNthPermutation()
[] Work on addition formula for combinadic (and permutadic) number system
[] Add API to find if permutation is even or odd
[] Add API to find the range of base of repetitive permutation for a
    given rank and permutation
