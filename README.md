# JNumberTools
**JNumberTools** is an open-source Java library designed to provide powerful tools for solving complex problems in combinatorics and number theory.

JNumberTools allows you to tackle challenging combinatorics problemsâ€”such as permutations, combinations, conditional-cartesian-products, ranking, partitions, etc. for both academic and practical applications in fields like mathematics, cryptography, data analysis, number theory, and algorithm design.

## ðŸ“¦ Latest Version
The latest release of the library is [v3.0.0](https://github.com/deepeshpatel/jnumbertools/releases/tag/v3.0.0).  
It is available through The Maven Central Repository [here](https://central.sonatype.com/search?q=jnumbertools&smo=true).
